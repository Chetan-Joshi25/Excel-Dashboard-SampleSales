# Excel-Dashboards
This is the first MS Excel Project. 

The dataset is a Sample Sales data. 
I analyzed the dataset using MS Excel. Since the dataset is small, the cleaning of the data was done instantly. 
I created a pivot table and refined the data points to align with the analysis requirements.
Worked upon the following charts:
# •	Sales by Months
# •	Sales by Salesperson
# •	Items sold by Category
# •	Items sold by Cities

Maximum sales of $2309 was carried in the month of June, while February had the lowest sales of $926. A line chart was used for the visualization, which clearly showed us the peaks and sales that took place over the year. 
I have used pie charts in order to see the items share in cities as well as the item category.
•	In Category, Cookies and Bars are the maximum selling items with a share of 47% and 37% respectively. 
•	While in cities, the maximum sale took place in Boston which is 40% of the total sales in the 4 cities. 
The sales by the 7 salespersons was also analyzed. This was done through a bar chart. Marc Williams was the person who did the highest sales of $4896.
